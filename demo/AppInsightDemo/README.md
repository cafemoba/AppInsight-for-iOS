### Introduction

This is a demo project to demonstrate some ways you can integrate **AppInsight.framework** with your app.

Demo project is a fork of Brandon Trebitowski's excellent ["Beginning UICollectionView..."](http://www.raywenderlich.com/22324/beginning-uicollectionview-in-ios-6-part-12) tutorial with slight modification, where all network activity use very popular iOS library [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking).

### To run

You'll need to register with [AppInsight](https//appinsight.cafemoba.com) and obtain API Key. After you do, replace the value of **AppInsight** key in _AppInsightDemo-Info.plist_.

You should be able to build and run the project in XCode simulator now.
